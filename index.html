        <strong>Abstract</strong>
        <p>In this this paper, we propose a new interactive visualization site allowing readers to better understand the emotions associated with 483 subreddits.  These visualizations are based over more than 58,000 Reddit posts, each classified with one or multiple of 29 distinct emotions in the GoEmotions dataset. Readers can then see the overlap between various Subreddit communities and get immediate insights as to the positivity and dominant emotions of each Subreddit. In order to achieve this visualization effort, we leverage D3.js to create a mix of an arc diagram, a Sankey diagram, a word cloud, a gauge chart and dynamic text displays. Each display was built to be simple enough to show immediate insights yet allow for various filtering and display clear examples. They allow us to gather powerful insights, such as how certain Subreddits (e.g. r/divorce) can be filled with gratitude and caring emotions and closely link to other similar Subreddits. We present this site as a contrast to most previous work which in most case focuses on binary emotions (e.g. positive vs negative or hate speech vs normal). We strongly believe that by showing a fine-grained view of the emotions present on social media, we can develop deeper insights for the moderation teams but also possibly improve efforts to identify Subreddits with common negative emotions.</p>
